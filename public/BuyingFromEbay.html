<h1>Buying used computers safely on Ebay</h1>

<span style="width: 500px;">Ebay
is a risky place to buy high-value goods - some would say that it's
impossible to buy a used computer safely on Ebay. I agree - you can
never
be completely safe when buying used goods from a stranger, which is
basically what Ebay is about. But there are mechanisms in place to
protect buyers under certain conditions, and I would still recommend
Ebay. If you take&nbsp;a few key precautions&nbsp;to minimise
the risk, in my experience there are significant advantages. I'm writing this article on
a Toshiba laptop which I bought from Ebay 2 and a half years ago, and
is still going strong. My wife's laptop was bought a few months later
from Ebay, and works fine. I've bought several laptops for other people and language projects
from Ebay, and had no significant problems with any of them! But I also
take a lot of precautions before buying computers on Ebay (more
about that below).<br>

</span><span style="width: 500px;"></span>
<h2>Why buy a used computer from Ebay?</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price</span>. On Ebay it's
not hard to find a 1-2 year old laptop for 50-75% of the new price.
Some still have a manufacturer's warranty.</span></li>

  <li><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice</span>. Laptop
models change every few months, so Ebay can help if you want a
particular model, which has been discontinued.&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standardisation</span>. If
you're in charge of&nbsp;a network, it makes life much easier if
you buy identical computers - that way, you can&nbsp;clone multiple
workstations using Ghost or Acronis,&nbsp;and hardware support
becomes much easier.</span></li>

</ul>

<span style="width: 500px;">Say
you buy one or two new
laptops for a language project, you set them up and decide that you
really like this model, for whatever reasons - build quality, battery
life, keeps cool in the heat, etc. A few months later, when you come to
buy more laptops,
you're not going to find the same model new anymore, so Ebay is the
obvious place to look. The alternative is to buy a new laptop, often a
model which you have never used, or even seen before. You take a
considerable risk when you do this, unless you have a
recommendation from someone whose judgement you trust. Will the
model you choose be sturdy and
reliable, or will it turn out to have some significant weakness? All
laptop makers turn out a few lemons, even our old SIL favourites
Toshiba and Dell - for example, laptops whose lids start cracking after
a few months, mouse buttons which come off and don't press down
properly, components that overheat easily, and other hardware &amp;
build quality problems. It
doesn't always follow that the cheaper models are the problematic ones,
either.<br>

</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important </span>precautions
to take</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="width: 500px;">If a seller has not sold several laptops
before and received excellent feedback for them, I would not buy from
them. </span></span><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="width: 500px;">You can easily check a seller's sales
history; it's now included as part of the
feedback profile.&nbsp;</span></span></li>

  <li><span style="width: 500px;"><span style="width: 500px;"></span></span>If
they have genuine-sounding negative feedback
comments from buyers, I would not buy from them.</li>
  <li>If their feedback score is less than about 20, I would not buy
from them. There are plenty of fraudsters who set up multiple accounts,
and try to "sell" goods which they don't actually have - they just lift
the photos and descriptions straight off the Internet. When the account
gets too much negative feedback, they just abandon it.</li>
  <li>If the listing doesn't explicitly state "excellent condition",
"perfect working order" or the like, I would contact them them and
check it before<br>

considering buying from them.</li>
  <li>I would only ever pay with PayPal - you have no protection if you pay through bank transfer or Western Union and the like.</li>
  <li>Check that the seller will ship to the place you want - for
example, many sellers will not send to an address that is not confirmed
with PayPal. Some will be flexible about this if you contact them ahead
of time...</li>
  <li>If anything in the listing makes me suspicious, I would pray about it, and if I still felt uneasy, I would not buy from them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>And a few general Ebay tips...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to bid on an auction listing (as opposed to a "Buy It
Now"),&nbsp;wait until the last minute before the auction ends if
possible, then bid your top price. Many people wait until the last
minute to bid, so the price often increases a lot at the very end. If
you bid earlier, the final price is likely to be pushed higher.</li>
  <li>Most items&nbsp;end in the late afternoon and evening, local
time, and these tend to attract the most bids. If you find an item
which ends in the morning or early afternoon, it's likely to finish
cheaper.</li>
  <li>Misspelt items often attract much fewer bids - try <a href="http://www.fatfingers.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.fatfingers.co.uk</a> to search for common misspellings. But be aware that the guy whose "Top of the range Tohsiba laptop" ends for $10 may not honour his contract to sell it at that price (would you? :-))</li>
</ul>
